# [How Software Development is Changing Forever, and How You'll Need to Change With it](https://dev.to/jdbar/how-software-development-is-changing-forever-and-how-youll-need-to-change-with-it-1jih)

This erticle, written by Joseph Barron, talks about the changes that AI has brought to companies and how that will effect developers in the future. As someone who will be working as a sofwatre developer, I have wondered what this new technology will mean for development. The article talks highly about the capabilities of AI, which is, it's ability to create working code. Many could see this as potential for jobs to decrease, but if anything, AI will just be a powerful tool for productivity. While AI can create code, it does not always mean they will be perfect. Developers must have a high technical skill level in order to ensure that the code AI does not produce an errors.

What I enjoy about this article is that it gives hope to developers and aspiring developers without shoving or scaring them away with the big buzzword that is AI. I am curious as to how AI will affect AI courses or classes in high school and college. Also, is it even necessary to learn about the basics like assmebly language to be a successful app builder?
